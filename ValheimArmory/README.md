# Valheim Armory
Valheim Armory is a continuation of Valheim Additions. A small mod designed to fill gaps in the valheim ecosystem.

The goal of this mod is to create a more diverse but not sprawling selection of weapons to make all playstyles feel fully supported at each level.


This mod is balanced to be mostly lore friendly with a preference for fun and enjoyable scaling and mechanics.

This mod is highly configurable, you can use all of it, parts or tune it as you need.

- This is my first Unity, and Valhiem mod
- My original goal with modding was to just make a singular new arrow
- I'm not a gamedev, I suck at textures, modeling and don't know the unity loaders

Below is more information on all of the items added, what tier they are in, where they are crafted and at what progression point. All of the sections below are expandable to view the details.

<details>
  <summary>Boss Weapons</summary>
  Currently the only added boss weapons are Eikthyrs

  These weapons are split into two groups, one requiring the workbench and the other the forge. Meaning that some of these weapons will require metals from the black forest.

  ### Eikthyrs

  <summary>Axes</summary>

  ### Greataxes (2H Axes)
  Battleaxes are a fun but very challenging playstyle in valheim. They are slow so you generally need to kill your opponets before they can kill you, which happens fast.

  | Name | Crafted At | Stage | Icon |
  | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Bronze Lumber Axe | Forge | Blackforest | ![bronze greataxe icon](https://i.imgur.com/1an32hc.png) |
  | Blackmetal Greataxe | Forge | Mistlands | ![blackmetal greataxe icon](https://i.imgur.com/2H94zhh.png) |

  <summary>Knives</summary>
  
  ### Added Daggers

  | Iron Dagger | Forge | Swamp | ![iron dagger icon](https://i.imgur.com/9MBSw5X.png) |
  | Silver Dagger | Forge | Mountain | ![silver dagger icon](https://i.imgur.com/SL2G0Vn.png) |

  ### Added 2H Daggers

  | Name | Crafted At | Stage | Icon |
  | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Rascal Daggers | Forge | Blackforest | ![rascal daggers icon](https://i.imgur.com/88MEras.png) |
  | Rogue Daggers | Forge | Swamp | ![rogue daggers icon](https://i.imgur.com/1kyTYjP.png) |
  | Blackguard Runic Daggers | Forge | Mountain | ![blackguard runic daggers icon](https://i.imgur.com/8HwWqah.png) |

  * Note: 2H Daggers will float infront of item wall mounts due to their separated attachment style. They display normally on an item stand.

  The addition of 2H daggers at lower tiers also provides you a way to focus on that playstyle all of the way up till the current end of the game.

## Configuration

Everything is optionally configurable through the ingame mod configuration UI provided by BepinEx.
  * [Thunderstore link](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/TJzilla/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
  * [Nexus Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/740)

Otherwise a configuration file located at `/BepInEx/config/com.midnightsfx.ValheimArmory.cfg` contains all of the configuration.

Please note that basically ALL of the configuration is server sided. Which means that **it requires a restart of your game to take effect**. This allows me to ensure that the server and the client are always in sync with the details of everything- like how much damage you did to that greydwarf.

Current configuration options:
* Damage
* Recipe
* Stamina cost
* Block amount
* Crafted amount (where applicable)
