## Configuration

Everything is optionally configurable through the ingame mod configuration UI provided by BepinEx.
  * [Thunderstore link](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/TJzilla/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
  * [Nexus Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/740)

Otherwise a configuration file located at `/BepInEx/config/MidnightsFX.ValheimArmory.cfg` contains all of the configuration.

Configuration is **server enforced** your client will adopt to using whatever configuration is specified on the server when connecting.

Most configuration values are updated in real-time. Tune your weapons quickly! If a configuration value is not updated while you are in game, logging out and back in will update it. You do not need to restart your client.

- Updating Crafting Recipe does require a 

Current configuration options:
* Damage
* Damage per level
* Recipe
* Stamina cost
* Block amount
* block per level
* Crafted amount (where applicable)
* movement speed (where applicable)

## FAQ

Q. Valheim Enchanting System doesn't support these weapons?
- A. There is a default VES config in the VA folder (`VES.ValheimArmory.default.yml`), it must be moved to the VES config folder. This gives you full control of configurations that are actually applied in regards to VES.
     The folder you should place this config file in is `BepInEx\config\ValheimEnchantmentSystem\AdditionalEnchantmentReqs`

Q. Epic Loot doesn't automatically drop these weapons, what gives?
- A. There is a default Epic Loot config files (`EpicLoot_Valheim_Armory.loottables.json, EpicLoot_Valheim_Armory.iteminfo.json`) in the VA folder, they must be moved to the Epic loot config patches folder. `\BepInEx\config\EpicLoot\patches`

Q. Why does disabling the recipe do nothing?
- A. You must have an item enabled, for the recipe disable flag to do anything. When an item is disabled it is completely removed from the game, so its recipe doesn't matter. Items can be uncraftable, and removed from the game seperately.

Q. I want to edit the text for a weapon, how do I do that?
- A. You can download a copy of any of the language files [available on github](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Armory/tree/master/ValheimArmory/localizations) and place it at the following location: `Valheim\BepInEx\plugins\ValheimArmory\Assets\Translations\YOUR_LANGUAGE_HERE\ValheimArmory.json` this will override
     the default localization for VA for the language specified. This is localization sideloading that is supported through [Jotunn](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/tutorials/localization.html#side-loading-localizations)
     I also accept language translation updates, if you want to translate or update an existing translation please reach out on the discord server or open a github ticket.

Q. Why does x weapon look bad?
- A.
    - This is my first Unity, and Valhiem mod
    - My original goal with modding was to just make a singular new arrow
    - I'm not a gamedev, I suck at textures, modeling and don't know the unity loaders
    - I'm learning as I go, and welcome feedback
    - I do this in my few hours of free time, sometimes I don't have that time

```

- Fixed wood bolt triggering the invalid recipe warning
- Fixed a particle mock for arrow feathers not resolving on some versions of valheim
- Rebalance of most boss weapons, and a few outlier non-boss weapons. Recipes are slightly more expensive overall and damage is generall down across the board.
    This primarily brings boss weapons in line with the next tier weapon minus a small bit. The balance change is just to the default config values.
    If you want to keep your weapons more powerful continue using your existing config, defaults will only be applied if you do not have a value set (new or deleted config).
