# Valheim Armory
Valheim Armory is a continuation of Valheim Additions. A small mod designed to fill gaps in the valheim ecosystem.

The goal of this mod is to create a more diverse but not sprawling selection of weapons to make all playstyles feel fully supported at each level.


This mod is balanced to be mostly lore friendly with a preference for fun and enjoyable scaling and mechanics.

This mod is highly configurable, you can use all of it, parts or tune it as you need.

Got a bug to report or just want to chat about the mod? Drop by the discord or github.

## Translations
This mod will always have an up-to-date English localization, as that is what I can provide as its author.
However, I do welcome community translations!

If you would like to contribute a new translation, or improve an existing one please feel free to reach out to me or provide a translation file in the same format as one of the existing ones.

  ## Eikthyrs

    Eikthyrs weapons are split into two groups, one requiring the workbench and the other the forge. Meaning that some of these weapons will require metals from the black forest.

  <summary>Axes</summary>

  ### Greataxes (2H Axes)
  Battleaxes are a fun but very challenging playstyle in valheim. They are slow so you generally need to kill your opponets before they can kill you, which happens fast.

  | Blackguard Runic Daggers | Forge | Mountain | `VAdagger_silver_2h` | ![blackguard runic daggers icon](https://i.imgur.com/8HwWqah.png) |

  * Note: 2H Daggers will float infront of item wall mounts due to their separated attachment style. They display normally on an item stand.

  The addition of 2H daggers at lower tiers also provides you a way to focus on that playstyle all of the way up till the current end of the game.

## Configuration

Everything is optionally configurable through the ingame mod configuration UI provided by BepinEx.
  * [Thunderstore link](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/TJzilla/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
  * [Nexus Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/740)

Otherwise a configuration file located at `/BepInEx/config/MidnightsFX.ValheimArmory.cfg` contains all of the configuration.

Please note that basically ALL of the configuration is server sided. Which means that **it requires a restart of your game to take effect**. This allows me to ensure that the server and the client are always in sync with the details of everything- like how much damage you did to that greydwarf.

Current configuration options:
* Damage
* Damage per level
* Recipe
* Stamina cost
* Block amount
* block per level
* Crafted amount (where applicable)

## FAQ

Q. Valheim Enchanting System doesn't support these weapons?
- A. There is a default VES config in the VA folder (`VES.ValheimArmory.default.yml`), it must be moved to the VES config folder. This gives you full control of configurations that are actually applied in regards to VES.
	 The folder you should place this config file in is `BepInEx\config\ValheimEnchantmentSystem\AdditionalEnchantmentReqs`

Q. Epic Loot doesn't automatically drop these weapons, what gives?
- A. There is a default Epic Loot config files (`EpicLoot_Valheim_Armory.loottables.json, EpicLoot_Valheim_Armory.iteminfo.json`) in the VA folder, they must be moved to the Epic loot config patches folder. `\BepInEx\config\EpicLoot\patches`

Q. The bronze crossbow costs dragon tears?
- A. Delete the config for the bronze crossbow (or your whole config file).

Q. Why does disabling the recipe do nothing?
- A. You must have an item enabled, for the recipe disable flag to do anything. When an item is disabled it is completely removed from the game, so its recipe doesn't matter.

Q. Why does x weapon look bad?
- A.
	- This is my first Unity, and Valhiem mod
	- My original goal with modding was to just make a singular new arrow
	- I'm not a gamedev, I suck at textures, modeling and don't know the unity loaders
	- I'm learning as I go, and welcome feedback
	- I do this in my few hours of free time, sometimes I don't have that time

- Added the option to enable/disable craftable state for all items. This is seperate from enabling the item itself, you can now enable the item to be loaded into the game.
