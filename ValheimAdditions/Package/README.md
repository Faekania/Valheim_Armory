# ValheimAdditions
Valheim Additions is a small mod designed to add some missing pieces to help fill gaps in the Valheim ecosystem. Hopefully this helps fill some gaps for others. 
These were things that I felt were missing from the game, 

This mod is balanced to be mostly lore friendly.


Disclaimer:
- This is my first Unity, and Valhiem mod
- I'm not a gamedev, I suck at textures, modeling and don't know the unity loaders
