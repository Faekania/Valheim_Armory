# ValheimAdditions
Valheim Additions is a small mod designed to add some missing pieces to help fill gaps in the Valheim ecosystem. Hopefully this mod helps fill that gaps for others too.

This mod is balanced to be mostly lore friendly with a preference for fun and enjoyable scaling and mechanics.


Disclaimer:
- This is my first Unity, and Valhiem mod
- I'm not a gamedev, I suck at textures, modeling and don't know the unity loaders

## Installation (Automatic)
Just download with your favorite modmanager!

## Installation (manual)
Toss the ValheimAdditions folder and files into your plugins folder. Technically the only thing required is the ValheimAdditions.ddl, configs will generate on first run.
